# **Vulnerability Scanner Web App**

### **Overview**
The Vulnerability Scanner Web App is a full-stack application designed to identify common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS) in websites. It allows users to enter a website URL, performs an automated scan, and provides a report with vulnerabilities found and recommended remediation steps.

This tool is designed to help businesses and developers improve the security of their web applications in a user-friendly way.

---

## **Features**
- **Automated Scanning**: Detects common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Provides actionable recommendations for each identified issue.
- **Detailed Reports**: Displays scan results in an easy-to-understand format.
- **Secure by Design**: Ensures the tool does not become an attack vector itself.

---

## **Tech Stack**
### **Frontend**
- **React.js**: For creating an interactive user interface.
- **Axios**: For making API requests.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js**: For handling API endpoints and business logic.
- **Golang**: For efficient, high-performance vulnerability scanning scripts.

### **Database**
- **MongoDB**: For storing scan results and logs.

### **Containerization**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For managing and deploying the application as microservices.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

---

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd vulnerability-scanner
```

---

### **3. Configure Environment Variables**
Create an `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
```env
# MongoDB Connection URI
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/vuln-scanner

# API Base URL (used by the React frontend)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

---

### **4. Run the Application**
#### Using Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Access the Application
- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
- **Backend API**: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## **Usage Instructions**

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Enter the URL of the website you want to scan.
3. Click on the **"Start Scan"** button.
4. Wait for the scan to complete and view the results displayed in the table.

---

## **Development Mode**
If you want to work on individual components of the app:

### **Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### **Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
node app.js
```

Ensure MongoDB is running locally or in Docker.

---

## **Stopping the Application**
To stop all running services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## **API Endpoints**
### **POST /api/scan**
- **Description**: Initiates a vulnerability scan on the provided URL.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "type": "SQL Injection",
          "description": "Detected SQL injection vulnerability",
          "recommendation": "Sanitize user inputs"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
